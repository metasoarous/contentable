h1. Contentable

Contentable is a gem for easing the process of dynamic content. It's all too easy to find situations in which there is content which needs to be inserted here in there in some web application, but which should be updatable on the fly. You could go with a content management system, but you really don't need that much power on that side and need more customization or want everything to be based in rails. This gem addresses this need.

Contentable works by letting you create a ContentItem (by default) model which encapsulates the content in textile format and has little helpers for rendering it. 

h2. How to use

At the moment this is still a work in progress. Check back later.

h2. TODO

* Make it so that a missing title brings up content not yet created content_item which is auto generated
* Create validations/protections on changing the content_item title name
* Create generators for view code, (migrations, etc?)
* ContentItem manager
* Support other markup languages
* Make it so that the class you include contentable in can be named whatever your want
* Integrate the textile helper
* Routing helpers

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
